        3. What Legal Bases Do We Rely On to Process Your Personal Information?
      </h2>
      <p>
        <em>In Short:</em> We only process your personal information when we
        believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal
        basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply

        to process your personal information:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Consent.</strong> We may process your information if you have
          given us permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal information
          for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time.
          Learn more about withdrawing your consent.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Performance of a Contract.</strong> We may process your

          contractual obligations to you, including providing our Services or at
          your request prior to entering into a contract with you.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Legal Obligations.</strong> We may process your information
          where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal
          obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or
          regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose
          your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Vital Interests.</strong> We may process your information
          where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or
          the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving
          potential threats to the safety of any person.
        </li>
      </ul>

          >If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        We may process your information if you have given us specific permission
        (i.e., express consent) to use your personal information for a specific
        purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e.,
        implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time.
      </p>
      <p>
        In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable
        law to process your information without your consent, including, for
        example:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent
          cannot be obtained in a timely way
        </li>
        <li>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</li>
        <li>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</li>
        <li>
          If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is
          necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim
        </li>
        <li>
          For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating
          with next of kin
        </li>
        <li>
          If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is,
          or may be victim of financial abuse
        </li>
        <li>
          If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would
          compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the
          collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a
          breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a
          province
        </li>
        <li>
          If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court
          order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records
        </li>
        <li>
          If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment,
          business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the
          purposes for which the information was produced
        </li>
        <li>
          If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary
          purposes
        </li>
        <li>
          If the information is publicly available and is specified by the

      <p>
        <em>In Short:</em> We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to
        collect and store your information.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons
        and pixels) to access or store information. Specific information about
        how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is
        set out in our Cookie Notice.
      </p>

      <h2 id="section6">6. How Do We Handle Your Social Logins?</h2>
      <p>
        <em>In Short:</em> If you choose to register or log in to our Services
        using a social media account, we may have access to certain information
        about you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your
        third-party social media account details (like your Facebook or Twitter
        logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile
        information about you from your social media provider. The profile
        information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider
        concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends
        list, and profile picture, as well as other information you choose to
        make public on such a social media platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are
        described in this privacy notice or that are otherwise made clear to you
        on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not control, and are
        not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your
        third-party social media provider. We recommend that you review their
        privacy notice to understand how they collect, use, and share your
        personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on
        their sites and apps.
      </p>

      <h2 id="section7">7. How Long Do We Keep Your Information?</h2>
      <p>
        <em>In Short:</em> We keep your information for as long as necessary to
        fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise
        required by law.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is
        necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a
        longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax,
        accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will
        require us keeping your personal information for longer than twelve (12)
        months past the termination of the user's account.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your
        personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such
        information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your
        personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will
        securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further
        processing until deletion is possible.
      </p>

      <h2 id="section8">8. How Do We Keep Your Information Safe?</h2>
      <p>
        <em>In Short:</em> We aim to protect your personal information through a
        system of organizational and technical security measures.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and
        organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any
        personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and
        efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the
        Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100%
        secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals,
        or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our
        security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your
        information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal
        information, transmission of personal information to and from our
        Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within
        a secure environment.
      </p>

      <h2 id="section9">9. Do We Collect Information From Minors?</h2>
      <p>
        <em>In Short:</em> We do not knowingly collect data from or market to
        children under 18 years of age.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18
        years of age. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least
        18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to
        such minor dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn that personal
        information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we
        will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly
        delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we
        may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at
        help@aurorabrickwell.com.
      </p>

      <h2 id="section10">10. What Are Your Privacy Rights?</h2>
      <p>
        <em>In Short:</em> In some regions, such as the European Economic Area
        (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), Switzerland, and Canada, you have rights
        that allow you greater access to and control over your personal
        information. You may review, change, or terminate your account at any
        time.
      </p>
      <p>
        In some regions (like the EEA, UK, Switzerland, and Canada), you have
        certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include
        the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal
        information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict
        the processing of your personal information; (iv) if applicable, to data

      <p><strong>Verification process</strong></p>
      <p>
        Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to
        determine you are the same person about whom we have the information in
        our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to provide
        information so that we can match it with information you have previously
        provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request you submit,
        we may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the
        information you provide with the information we already have on file, or
        we may contact you through a communication method (e.g., phone or email)
        that you have previously provided to us. We may also use other
        verification methods as the circumstances dictate.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify
        your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent possible,
        we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the
        purposes of verification. However, if we cannot verify your identity
        from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you
        provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your
        identity and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete
        such additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying
        you.

        </li>
        <li>
          You can designate an authorized agent to make a request under the CCPA
          on your behalf. We may deny a request from an authorized agent that
          does not submit proof that they have been validly authorized to act on
          your behalf in accordance with the CCPA.
        </li>
        <li>
          You may request to opt out from future selling or sharing of your

          submission.
